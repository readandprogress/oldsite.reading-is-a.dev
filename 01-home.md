    <p>Hey there! I go by Reading, which has been my online alias for a while now. It originally used to be two words, but since me and others have a knack for shortening it to just the first word, I decided to use that instead, and I haven't looked back! I quite like it, and I will probably keep it for the long haul, but I digress!</p> 
    <p>I'm currently aspiring to start a career as a technical writer, so studying and freelance work have kept me quite busy. In my free time, I like to maintain this personal website you are now on! write all sorts of posts, watch or read some anime and manga, play games, and I recently got into the hobby of building Gunpla!</p>
    <p>I'm quite a tech enthusiast and huge proponent of open-source software and hardware. I daily drive Linux and I mostly live in the shell.</p>
    <p>I write as well, <em>though not as much as I like</em>, but hopefully that will change soon as I continue to work on some writing projects of mine. I'm currently getting into original fiction with a short novel I'm conceptualizing; there's nothing to show just yet, but I'm quite excited about it! </p>
