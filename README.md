# The Reading Dimension

> ## *"A dimension like no other."*

The Reading Dimension is my blog and first web dev project I took upon. I've been slowly refining it, but it still has a long way to go before I'm really happy with it! It's in a *"good enough"* shape that I mostly focus on content for now. But I admit that when I started this project, I thought I would enjoy the aspect of blogging itself more, but in actuality, I enjoy doing both! It's really fun seeing your site evolve over time, and mine has just started that process. Just like a Pok√©mon before evolution.

## Tech Stack

The stack I use for this porject is quite minimal. All my code and writing is done with VS Code; a bit much for what I need but surprisingly easy to pick up and learn. I use Git for version control and I use Jekyll as my SSG (Static Site Generator), which I really like. I've heard of other options that may be better suited for me, but for now, as a beginner, I'll stick with Jekyll and learn it inside and out before trying other SSGs. As for hosting, I use Cloudflare Pages generous free plan. It works seamlessly with GitHub and was a huge upgrade from GitHub Pages!

## Roadmap!

Like I said, my blog is on the precipice of evolving! I'm planning on revamping it from the ground up, well not the *actual* ground up, but you get the gist! While I love my blog as it is, I feel like it can do more. So after some digging I learned about Digital Gardens, and I was absolutely in love with the idea! It's like a hub for all your ideas and thoughts! You can have shorter micro posts or status updates, full-on articles, evergreen posts, Posts that by design aren't dated as soon as you commited it. You can share what you have read, watched, listened to, or played and share your thoughts on it. It really encapsulates the phrase; "your corner on the web." This will be this project's next stage! But change happens gradually, so behold, a roadmap!

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Switching to Minimal Mistakes | While not the only contender for a new skin, this one is the most likely. I really like its templating. If I were more knowledgeable, I would make my own, but I'm not there yet! | Planning |
| Linking existing posts | This is a basic foundation of a digital garden, and it should be easy to implement.                                                                                                                                      | Planning |
| New Feeds page | Since I'm going to have more content other than posts, a dedicated feeds page is a must as I'll be adding different feeds from different content streams.                                                                  | Planning |
| Search function | Pretty self-explanatory, and Minimal Mistakes provides it by default, so it should be easy to implement.                                                                                                                | Planning |
| New Home Page | Curated, minimal with points of interests, like a nice collage!                                                                                                                                                          | Planned  |
| Articles Page | With a digital garden, I don't feel the need to post regularly, so I can take some time and work on some articles, and in fact, some of my posts already meet that criteria!                                           | Planning |
| Now Page | I've been meaning to add a now page for a while now! It's a really cool way to keep up with your bloggers.                                                                                                              | Planning |
| Uses Page | A page just to list and detail what you use and your setup? Sign me up!                                                                                                                                                 | Planning |
| Micro page | While I won't feel the need to post as often, I still don't want to leave my readers without content, so enter the /micro page! Think social media but better in every way! In short, short messages on what I'm up to. (Yes, that was on purpose.) | Planning |
| Links page | A fusion of a blogroll and cool bookmarks I like to share.                                                                                                                                                               | Planning |
| WebMentions | This will probably be the most difficult and funnest to implement.                                                                                                                                                       | Planning |
| Adding a Backlog page | A page just for my many backlogs! Gaming, anime, reading, etc., annotated with my notes.                                                                                                                                | Planning |
