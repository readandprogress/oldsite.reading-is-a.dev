Hey! Welcome to my blog! I'll go by Reading, and I have a huge passion for technology and writing! I've been meaning to create this blog for a while now but never got around to it. (Procrastination is my worst enemy.) But it is finally here! and I will be covering a variety of topics, such as:

## Tech

I'm a huge proponent of open-source software and hardware; I use ChromeOS and Debian as my regular day-to-day drivers! I also have a small home server, so I look forward to reading more about it soon!

## Gaming

I love RPGs! (Specifically JRPGs.) My favorites include the Fire Emblem, Pokemon, and Valkyria Chronicles series! I also love some indies like Superhot and Downwell.

## Anime 


I'm an avid watcher of anime and usually gravitate to the fantasy, adventure, and mecha genres, with some Isekai sprinkled in there! My favorites include Mobile Suit Gundam, Code Geass, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, and Gundam Build Fighters! 


## Manga

I don't read as much as I should, but I love reading manga when I do! Favorites include Moriarty the Patriot, Pokemon Special/Adventures, and currently really enjoying the Fire Emblem Engage manga.


## Writing

Like I said, I'm a writer, and I'm planning a few short stories and novels. I'm currently working on an original piece that I would love to tell you all more about soon! All I can say for now is that if you like tech-related stories, this will be right up your alley!

## Gunpla

I have just started getting into building gunpla kits, and I'm equally excited to share my builds with you all, straight assembles, because I'm not *that* good yet!

## General

For everything that doesn't fit anywhere else, like this very post! Sometimes I want to post something away from the usual when the mood strikes; this category gives me the space to do just that!

This won't be everything I want to cover, but I'll mostly focus on these five categories. Nothing is ever final, so I may change things around, but if you like what you read, be sure to subscribe to my RSS feed so you don't miss a post!

Thanks for reading!
