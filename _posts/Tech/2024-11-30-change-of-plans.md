It has been a while since I talked about changing my humble blog into a digital garden, all the way back in February of this year. As you can see, now nearing the end of the year, my website remains mostly the same.

So, what happened?

After trying out a few themes, including the aforementioned Minimal Mistakes, I found all of them to be lacking in one way or another—either a missing feature or the design not being to my liking.

So instead, I'm going to stick with the venerable Minima theme and build on top of that for now. I find the Minima theme to be almost what I'm looking for, just missing a few things that will make it a perfect fit for me.

I'm still planning to implement most of the features that I mentioned, with some new additions as well.

Expect some of them in the upcoming weeks. (•‿•)
