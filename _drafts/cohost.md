With the recent news of Cohost[^1] shutting down and archival. I thought it would be good time to fill people in on my experiences with it, being that I used to be fellow user for a short time around Spring of last year.

## Why I Left

So I joined cohost mostly as a trial thing, I wasn't really super interesting in it per say. I never was someone for social media. I of course used some of them when they we're the in-new thing back in the day but I never care to keep up with them, they all soon disappeared into the abyss for me.

What brought me in and how I used cohost was as a micro-blogging platform, where I can post short tidbits and the like that I don't feel a need for a whole post or meeting a certain quality standard. I consider it the inbetween of messages in chatting platform like Discord for example and full blown out posts on a blog.

And for that purpose it work out pretty well! I found a bunch a cool interesting blogs and their creators on cohost and all seem well from the start.
