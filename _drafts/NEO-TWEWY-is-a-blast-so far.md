![The long awaited sequel to TWEWNY!](https://i.ibb.co/jJLms4P/The-Game-Begins.jpg)

After finishing Fire Emblem Engage at the beginning of the year (by the way, that review is still inbound), I want to mention that I'm working on completing all the supports first, and that is taking a while...

But moving on! I've been playing NEO: The World Ends With You and just recently finished it. It was a nice, enjoyable break from the turn-based games I'm used to and probably one of the funniest gameplay loops in recent memory. A game where griding is fun and enjoyable and rewarded with a sliding difficulty scale that you can tailor to your experience, overleveled a bit trying to master some pins? Just unlock other difficulty modes, like hard mode, and you're back to enjoying a fair challenge, or if you just want to cruise through the story and what a story it is! (More about that later.) You can unlock a easy mode! (which I used a fair amount of times to grind my pins!) NEO has you covered. I love when games make playing them so accessible; not everyone has the time to grind or invest countless hours into a game. With so many games coming out, who can blame them?

But before I can keep gushing about this game, let me backtrack a bit. I started NEO back when the demo came out and immediately fell in love with it. The action-style combat was a breath of fresh air compared to my usual genre of turn-based RPGs. More importantly, the characters and story were engaging and interesting, leaving me eager to know more after the first chapter ended. Needless to say, I immediately wishlisted the game after finishing the demo. I was occupied with other games at the time, so it had to wait a while (for those curious, I was playing Superhot, Fire Emblem Three Houses and the accompanying DLC Cindered Shadows, and wrapping up the year with Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon and The Blade of Light).

So I was excited when it was on sale late last year, so I quickly snatched it, but with Engage coming out and being busy with other games, it took till summer before I was able to pick it up again.

Jumping back in with my demo save file (I really appreciate it when games allow you to transfer demo save data; this should be standard practice if it isn't already!), I was concerned that I might be a bit lost in the story department. However, to my surprise, I was able to quickly pick up the story bits, and it felt as if I had just played the game a few weeks ago. I'm not sure if that's because the story clicked with me so much or if my perception of time is skewed due to previous world events. Regardless, I'm glad either way because I already had a considerable collection of mastered pins and was aiming to complete the whole set, maybe even 100% complete the game, which is a hard ask with other games on my backlog as of now. Ah, the woes of a completionist: to finish or complete, that is the question!

But I digress. NEO is a sequel to The World Ends With You, a game I haven't played yet. Normally, I try to play the first game in a series of games, but I decided to watch the anime instead, which was surprising enjoyable for a video game adaptation (not to say there are no good ones, cough Persona 4 cough). This allowed me to get the overall gist of the story of the first game, minus the new content added to Final Remix. Speaking of Final Remix, I was originally intending to play it instead, but after giving it a shot when it was available as a game trial on Nintendo Switch Online, I soon found out that the game uses motion or touch controls and nothing else, both of which I quite detest, at least as the sole way of controlling a game. I like my buttons. Thank you very much!

So then I thought about playing the original on the DS, but sadly, DS game prices on the second-hand market are quite ridiculous, so I quickly shelfed that idea, leaving me with watching a playthrough or the anime; the latter sounded way more enticing and less time-consuming, plus I personally prefer playing the game than watching a playthrough.

After mostly binging the anime, I felt that I had enough info from the first game to fully enjoy NEO, but now this isn't true; you can enjoy NEO just fine by itself but as I wanted to get to the full gist of it, I *had* to watch it. 


But I'm glad I did. The original game has a really compelling story and fun characters, some of whom return in NEO.  

But the main focus is on the new cast, and they make quite an impression! The game starts with two friends, Rindo and Fret, who are just hanging out in Shibuya.
