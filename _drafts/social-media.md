During my time on the interwebs I have used many social media platforms and none of them ever stuck with me. I wasn't much of a fan, as a early netizen I was accustomed to forums, message boards and IRC chatrooms. For me these new fangled social networks we're robbed of all the uniqueness of the early web. 

One of the reasons I started this blog was so I could have a place to write about my interests without depending on any platform. This has is caveats; discovery for one being one of the biggest. 

Even so the pros outweight the cons for me. Having my own corner of the web where every decision is mine and mine alone is *liberating*.

But I can see why some might not want to make that jump,finding an audience is hard enough, if you managed to carve out a following is only logical you want to hold on to them.
