I've been having trouble writing fiction as of late, I have this project I really like to get the first chapter out this year but all I managed to write was the worldbuilding, CVs and some notes.

One problem I have is focusing more on it, while writing is not hard in itself brainstorming is and just waiting for inspiration to strike me won't cut it anymore. I want to make real progress and one thing that writing these posts taught me is that just the action of getting the words on the screen can help get those cretive juices flowing.

So I'm setting a challenge for myself, I'm going to try and write specifically for this project and get atleast a solid half-an hour of writing for next week, for you though it will be following seven days after this post gets publish on a Saturday. 

The goal is here to get all if most of brainstorming done, any progress on the first chapter is just a bonus and hopefully this could be good start of making it a habit.

Thirty minutes is not a daunting goal and isn't insignificant either, I think it strikes a good balance for interdiamiate writer as myself. I also like that is a time goal and not word count goal. From my experience word counts based goals can be intimating when starting and demotivating when you fail. It can also incetivice padding things out just to meet a threshould and anyways for this I want to mostly focus on ideas so a word count is insufficient and illsuited. 

But yeah with that said I will be taking reflection notes after each session and posting them here once the week is over I will compile them into one and do a final review. This will give a rough idea on what I can improve upon. 

As always, thanks for reading! If your a fellow writer as well, I would love to know what tips and tricks do you use to keep yourself motivated?  Let me know over my contact page!
