## About Me

I supposed you like to know more about me right? Well allow me to introduce myself! As you may have guessed, I go by Reading and is been my handle for a while now. You may ask why I don't share my real name? Well I believe in anonimity and privacy online first and foremost and since this is a personal blog, I don't think there's a need, Although if you like to know my real name get in contact and I will hapily let you know!

So where were with? Ah yes, I'm currently getting certified in CyberSec and Technical Writing and will love a career in them hopefully. I currently reside in the States, Florida specifically which is nice for now but I don't have much interest in it other than some family. I don't travel much as of now but I like to change that and visit Japan! One of my biggest dreams is rumaging trough Akihabara for tech and video game goodies!

As you can see, I have huge passion for tech and well... Writing!
I kinda have to having a blog and all, but other that this project, I like to dable in fiction and have so many ideas floating through my head but unfortunately none of them have landed on paper yet! (＾▽＾;)

I do hope to change that soon! I have a concept that I'm working and I'm hoping to get the first chapter out soon.

What else? Right hobbies! Most of my hobbies are pretty common if wasn't already obvious gaming is one of them, usually RPGs but I do play other genres as well when the mood strikes, If I'm not Gaming, I'm Reading, get it? Bad joke aside I usually gravitate toward nonfiction when it comes too books even though I write fiction, weird right? I do however avidly read manga. I watch TV like most people usually YouTube or anime. When I'm not doing either of those I'm either writing a post or more reasonably tinkering or building a Gunpla kit!

## About the Blog
 
The website your currently on! Joking aside I created this blog to have a place on interwebs of my very own.

Having my own place online that I decide every aspect of is incredibly valuable for me and I implore you to spin off your own! We can always use more blogs! But I digress!

I wanted for long time to try blogging, I just never got around to it until recently, I love writing and writing about my interests and hobbies is increadibly cathartic, I had come to enjoy the act of it by itself! But I find incredibly rewarding that others enjoy reading it aswell!

This was and still is a fun web dev project for me, I recently learned the fundamentals and wanted a way to apply them so this worked perfectly! I will keep constantly updating and revamping this site as I slowly get better at web development. Can't wait to see how much has changed in a few years!

With that said this blog focuses on a varity of topics instead of just one, in turn hence the name; **The Reading Dimension**. I think it fits it quite well! Everything you need to know is on the tin like it should.

So what can you expect on your feed? I mostly write about tech and post hopefully helpful guides, well not as much as I would like I do write about my favorite video games and do reviews, I plan to talk about anime and manga as well and I would like to try doing some Gunpla reviews or show some of my builds, Occasionally you see one of my more general posts slip by too.

So if your like what you see, head over to my RSS feed! I try to post monthly but may sometimes post more if the mood strikes.
