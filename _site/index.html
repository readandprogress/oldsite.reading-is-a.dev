        </h3>Recently, I've been dealing with transferring large files, and while there are plenty of tools available to do the job, most of them are slow, have a size limit, or are cumbersome to set up. Luckily, I learned about a powerful and simple-to-use tool called croc while looking for alternatives, and it's exactly what I've been looking for in a file transfer tool!</li><li>

So after some deliberation on my part and some fellow server members showing interest,I decided to write one! This guide 's goal is to hopefully be easier to understand and follow than the already existing Discord Markdown 101 support page.
