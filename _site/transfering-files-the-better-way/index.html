        <p>Recently, I’ve been dealing with transferring large files, and while there are plenty of tools available to do the job, most of them are slow, have a size limit, or are cumbersome to set up. Luckily, I learned about a powerful and simple-to-use tool called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">croc</code> while looking for alternatives, and it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for in a file transfer tool!</p>

<p>Fast, easy to use, and secure! It’s so good that it’s odd I haven’t seen it mentioned much. So, to remedy that, let me tell you all about it!</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">croc</code> is a CLI(Command-line Interface) cross-platform file transfer tool. Now, I know for some, the CLI may seem daunting, and you may scoff at the idea of it being simple, but it really is!</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">croc</code> commands are simple to grasp and straightforward. If you have just a tiny bit of experience in the CLI, you’ll be fine. For those who don’t, I’ll try my best to make it as easy as possible.</p>

<p>First, let’s install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">croc</code>. It’s available on most popular Linux distributions and, of course, on BSDs, Mac, and Windows, but I’ll be focusing on Linux for this guide.</p>

<p>I’m using Debian, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">croc</code> is available from the official repo, so all we have to do is:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>croc <span class="nt">-y</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, on the receiving device, an Android tablet, I’m using Termux, and “croc” is available on the base repo as well, so again, it’s super easy to install!</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pkg update
pkg upgrade
pkg <span class="nb">install </span>croc <span class="nt">-y</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be sure to install any updates if available before installing “croc”. This is Linux CLI 101! If you’re wondering why there’s “-y” after the command, it’s just so “apt” knows that we confirmed the install; otherwise, you’ll get a prompt after executing the command.</p>

<p>Now that we have “croc” installed, let’s start by sending a file. For example, I have this huge archive file filled with downloaded YouTube video files that I’d like to have on my tablet for later viewing. Luckily, “croc” can handle large files just fine. Since it’s a direct connection between devices, it’s fast and has no limits on file size other than your own storage limitations.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>croc send youtube-videos.zip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">croc</code> will then do its preparations and leave you with a code like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Code is: 4812-airline-lima-script
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On your receiving device type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">croc</code> and intiate it. You will get a prompt asking for your code.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Enter receive code:
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, just enter your code, and “croc” will do the rest! It’s pretty zen-like just seeing it go.</p>

<p>Once it’s done, your file or files should be happily sitting in the directory where you initiated the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">croc</code> command. So, what do you think? Not that hard, right? And you didn’t have to deal with slow cloud storage services or emailing yourself a file…</p>

<p>But now you know better! And that’s what counts at the end of the day.</p>
