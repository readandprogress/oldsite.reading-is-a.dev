      <p>I frequent Discord quite often and I don't see many members using Markdown syntax to flair out their messages, which is a shame. So after some deliberation on my part and some fellow server members showing interest,I decided to write one!

This is, however, my first time writing a guide, so please bear with me! But with that said, let's get to it!</p> <!-- Display the excerpt for each post -->
