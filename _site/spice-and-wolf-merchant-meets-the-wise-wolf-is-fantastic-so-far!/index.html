<p>I’m not much of a seasonal anime watcher, but this last season is an exception! With the return of the fantastic Spice and Wolf! And now that the first half has finished airing, I’d like to share my thoughts on it!</p>

<p>Now I have only seen the first Spice and Wolf anime, several times, I might add! So keep that in mind. I’m sure the light novels are fantastic, and I will surely read them one day! But for now, I will only be comparing it to the original anime.</p>

<p>The series is aptly subtitled Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf.</p>

<p>It really encapsulates that this is the beginning of their story, and I expect that the next season will have its own distinct subtitle hinting at the events to be unfolded.</p>

<p>The anime itself is unique; not many anime that I know of tackle the subject of economics, and Spice and Wolf really delivers on this front! It makes economics interesting and fun.</p>

<p>Besides the fun world of trade and myths, The characters are also fun, sassy, and memorable. You have the great Holo as the main protagonist!</p>

<p>She’s witty, snarky, and, of course, wise, and she contrasts well with our other protagonist, Kraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant knowledgeable in his trade but still kind to others and not just looking to fatten his pockets.</p>

<p>They make a great pair, and their growing romance isn’t forced or stilted; they just genuinely care for each other, which is refreshing to see!</p>

<p>I’m watching the dub as I usually do when available, and I’m happy to report that the voice actors from the first series have returned to reprise their roles! I haven’t checked the credits to be sure, but if there are any replacements, then they are really good replacements!</p>

<p>Overall, I’m halfway through this twenty-five-episode romp, and I’m enjoying it immensely! I really hope we get a continuation; looking at its popularity, it’s pretty likely. I can’t wait to see the rest of their story!</p>
