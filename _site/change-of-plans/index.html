        <p>It has been a while since I talked about changing my humble blog into a digital garden, all the way back in February of this year. As you can see, now nearing the end of the year, my website remains mostly the same.</p>

<p>So, what happened?</p>

<p>After trying out a few themes, including the aforementioned Minimal Mistakes, I found all of them to be lacking in one way or another—either a missing feature or the design not being to my liking.</p>

<p>So instead, I’m going to stick with the venerable Minima theme and build on top of that for now. I find the Minima theme to be almost what I’m looking for, just missing a few things that will make it a perfect fit for me.</p>

<p>I’m still planning to implement most of the features that I mentioned, with some new additions as well.</p>

<p>Expect some of them in the upcoming weeks. (•‿•)</p>
