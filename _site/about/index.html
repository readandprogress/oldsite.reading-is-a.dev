<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I suppose you would like to know more about me, right? Well, allow me to introduce myself! As you may have guessed, I go by Reading, and it has been my handle for a while now. You may ask why I don’t share my real name. Well, I believe in anonymity and privacy online first and foremost. Since this is a personal blog, I don’t think there’s a need. Although, if you would like to know my real name, get in contact, and I will happily let you know!</p>

<p>So, where were we? Ah, yes, I’m currently getting certified in CyberSec and Technical Writing and would love a career in them, hopefully. I currently reside in the States, specifically Florida, which is nice for now, but I don’t have much interest in it other than some family. I don’t travel much as of now, but I would like to change that and visit Japan! One of my biggest dreams is rummaging through Akihabara for tech and video game goodies!</p>

<p>As you can see, I have a huge passion for tech and, well… writing! I kind of have to, having a blog and all, but other than this project, I like to dabble in fiction and have so many ideas floating through my head. Unfortunately, none of them have landed on paper yet! (＾▽＾;)</p>

<p>I do hope to change that soon! I have a concept that I’m working on, and I’m hoping to get the first chapter out soon.</p>

<p>What else? Ah, hobbies! Most of my hobbies are pretty common if it wasn’t already obvious. Gaming is one of them, usually RPGs, but I do play other genres as well when the mood strikes. If I’m not gaming, I’m reading. Get it? Bad joke aside, I usually gravitate toward nonfiction when it comes to books, even though I write fiction. Weird, right? I do, however, avidly read manga. I watch TV like most people, usually YouTube or anime. When I’m not doing either of those, I’m either writing a post or, more reasonably, tinkering or building a Gunpla kit!</p>

<h2 id="about-the-blog">About the Blog</h2>

<p>The website you’re currently on! Joking aside, I created this blog to have a place on the interwebs of my very own.</p>

<p>Having my own place online that I decide every aspect of is incredibly valuable to me, and I implore you to spin off your own! We can always use more blogs! But I digress!</p>

<p>I wanted for a long time to try blogging; I just never got around to it until recently. I love writing, and writing about my interests and hobbies is incredibly cathartic. I have come to enjoy the act of it by itself! But I find it incredibly rewarding that others enjoy reading it as well!</p>

<p>This was and still is a fun web dev project for me. I recently learned the fundamentals and wanted a way to apply them, so this worked perfectly! I will keep constantly updating and revamping this site as I slowly get better at web development. I can’t wait to see how much has changed in a few years!</p>

<p>With that said, this blog focuses on a variety of topics instead of just one, hence the name; The Reading Dimension. I think it fits quite well! Everything you need to know is on the tin like it should.</p>

<p>So what can you expect on your feed? I mostly write about tech and post hopefully helpful guides. Well, not as much as I would like. I do write about my favorite video games and do reviews. I plan to talk about anime and manga as well, and I would like to try doing some Gunpla reviews or show some of my builds. Occasionally, you may see one of my more general posts slip by too.</p>

<p>So if you like what you see, head over to my RSS feed! I try to post monthly but may sometimes post more if the mood strikes.</p>

<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2>

<p>The tech stack I use for this blog is quite minimal; I’m big into the KISS philosophy.</p>
