        <p>Before we get started, I just realized that this year is a <em>leap</em> year! Making this a <em>leap</em> post! Just found that tidbit cool and fitting for our topic today!</p>

<p>I haven’t updated you all about my website in a while, last time was when I had transition into Cloudflare Pages and moved into a newer version of Jekyll and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minima</code> theme gem.</p>

<p>This time I want to share some plans I have for the future of my website and what that means for you!</p>

<p>First off, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minima</code> theme has served me well I have grown to see that it doesn’t fit what I want for a theme.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minima</code> is very simple and minimalistic by design which is the reason I picked it but there’s a few features that I would really like missing, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no option to add a logo, you can however tinker around with CSS and HTML and add it that way but is not a simple or a easy solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s not a natively built-in search function, which for what I want to transform this website into needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No native support for header images, while not a necessity is a nice to have feature.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While I love the simplicity of the theme, it is just too simple for me. I want minimalism. But I do want to be able to express myself as well!</p>

<p>This bring us to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimal-mistakes</code>! A minimal theme but with way more features built-in than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minima</code>. It has everything I ever want or need!</p>

<p>A search function, built-in logo support, header images, and not to mention a way more fitting theme for a digital garden!
Plus it is well documented unlike <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minima</code>, so a web dev newbie like me can get behind it!</p>

<p>But I bet your thinking; “That’s all well and good but what’s this about a digital garden?”.
So for those of you uninformed I’ll be glad to filled you in!</p>

<p>A digital garden is much like any other website but focused on creating and fostering ideas or I guess you could say planting and nurturing ideas!</p>

<p>It focuses on linking ideas together and curation  unlike a blog where old posts fall to the wayside for newer posts, posts can be evergreen and be updated with new links and info over time.</p>

<p>Instead of scrolling a feed you’ll land on a homepage of feature articles, posts or notes curated by the writer and when you click one you’ll noticed that they bidirectionally linked, a post can lead other posts like and endless rabbit hole of ideas.</p>

<p>Another boon of a digital garden is that is not just a blog your not limited in what you want to curated and showcase in this space!</p>

<p>For example you can have a list of games you have played, your favorites, what are you currently playing and more! You can engage with your audience in more ways than one.</p>

<p>In a nutshell a digital garden is personal space online that you make your own with whatever interests you!</p>

<p>So what does that mean for this website? Well, nothing much will change since even before I knew about this concept I wanted to make more than just a blog and create a place of the Internet for myself.</p>

<p>A portal to my world as it were, In fact that’s what the name comes from! My very own dimension online but it also serves a double meaning, I wanted this dimension to be a place of learning as well this is why about half of my posts are guides or tutorials.</p>

<p>And that fits perfectly with digital gardens since they place a huge deal on public learning. So if anything I will just add more content and deeper insight into my interests.</p>

<p>I’ll still have a page with chronologically sorted posts for those who want to read the latest and for feed readers. But I will slowly put more emphasis on curation and if your looking for something in particular you can always search for it!</p>

<p>I also want to add a microblog to this digital garden as well! I just recently left cohost! Because I barely used it, and it looks too much like social media that I grew to despise nowadays. But with it, I lose out on its microblogging aspects, so I’m making my own!</p>

<p>The plan is to write my thoughts daily that later can become full on posts or articles! Making the writing process much easier.</p>

<p>“So when will we expect these changes?” You might ask? Well not anytime soon, I haven’t even began tinkering with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimal-mistakes</code> yet! Is going to take a while why I finished customizing the theme and making sure is well polished. But you can expect it this year at least.</p>

<p>This will be a big <em>leap</em> for this website and is next real evolution and I hope you are excited as much as I am for it! For now though expect a new post mid March!</p>
