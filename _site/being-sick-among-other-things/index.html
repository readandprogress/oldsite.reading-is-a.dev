        <p>I planned for this blog to be for long-form posts, but I guess I can make an exception for today, and microblogs and microblogging are pretty cool! But I digress.</p>

<p>So, hey, how are you? Hopefully you’re feeling better than me because I’ve been sick for the second time this month, and well, it definitely made blogging hard this month. Among other things, I was planning to write and publish a new post about me decommissioning my home server due to a power supply failure (yep, that is also a bummer but more of a blessing in disguise in my view). and I’ve started writing a Fire Emblem Engage review, which I would be able to finish once I’ve finished my second run of the game with all of the DLC. That way, I can cover everything and give my full opinion of the game now that it has been out for four months.</p>

<p>Regardless, I’m writing this short post now because I wanted to publish one post each month at least, but to make up for it, I’m going to do my best to publish two posts next month, one of which is the mentioned home server post, and the other is likely to be the Fire Emblem Engage review. With that said, I’m going to get some rest, and hopefully I don’t get <em>sick</em> again this year.</p>
