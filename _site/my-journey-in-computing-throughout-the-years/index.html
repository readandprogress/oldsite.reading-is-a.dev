<p>I’ve been into computing for two decades now—yes, I’m old. (◔‿◔)</p>

<p>In that time, I have gone through four computers; one laptop and three desktops, experimenting with several operating systems and applications!</p>

<h2 id="1999---2004-compaq-presario-7400-series">1999 - 2004 Compaq Presario 7400 Series</h2>

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>
<p style="text-align:center">Not my exact model or picture, but is the closest to the one we had back then!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>My first PC, or should I say our first family computer, was a Compaq Presario 7400 series desktop tower. I’m not sure of the precise model, but I remember it had a Pentium 3 CPU, 64 MB of RAM, a 30GB HDD, and ran on Windows 98. It even came with an upgrade CD to Windows 98 SE!</p>

<p>I have fond memories of playing games, going online for the first time, and slowly learning more about computers during that period. I remember reading both the accompanying manuals quite frequently; it was the closest thing to scratching the itch when the computer was occupied by my father or sister.</p>

<p>It eventually became my own computer when my dad upgraded to a new custom-built PC and my sister bought herself a laptop. Even though it was a hand-me-down, I was quite happy to have a PC all to myself!</p>

<p>Although I don’t use Windows anymore, Windows 98 will always have a special spot in my heart!</p>

<h2 id="2004---2009-custom-built-pentium-4-desktop">2004 - 2009 Custom Built Pentium 4 Desktop</h2>

<p>Around the time I was in middle school, my dad surprised me with a custom-built PC! I don’t know much about its components, but it had a Pentium 4 CPU, 1GB of RAM, 300GB HDD, internal graphics, and a copy of Windows XP. It was a good machine and it worked terrifically well!</p>

<p>Windows XP was also more stable than Windows 98, so it made for a pleasant experience. However, unlike 98, I hold no love for XP; Sorry XP Fans!</p>

<p>This was also the time when I became more interested in Linux! I had read about it before and was intrigued, but this is when I learned more about it and started ordering those free Live CDs! Fun times.</p>

<h2 id="2009---2014-hp-pavilion-slimline-s5600-series">2009 - 2014 HP Pavilion Slimline s5600 Series</h2>

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>
<p style="text-align:center">The Pavilion Slimline Case still holds up in my opinon!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When I enrolled in university for my major in Computer Science, I needed a new machine because my old one was left at my dad’s when we moved, and it was time for an upgrade!</p>

<p>I was advised to get a laptop, which in hindsight was probably the best choice. However, I was stubborn and preferred the repairability and power of a desktop since I rarely needed to leave my desk. So, I received an HP Pavilion Slimline desktop as a gift from my mom. Its slim case was perfect for my desk space, and it looked great too! It featured a Pentium Duo CPU, my first dual-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, a 500GB HDD, Intel HD internal graphics, and a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>

<p>This machine was fantastic! It ran smoothly without any issues and was quite impressive for an entry-level rig at that time!</p>

<p>Windows 7 was also pleasant to use. Even though I was already using Linux and enjoying it, I decided to stick with Windows 7 on this machine. I eventually installed Kubuntu, and it ran fantastically!</p>

<h2 id="2014---2018-the-dark-era">2014 - 2018 The Dark Era</h2>

<p>During late 2014 I moved over to Florida and with it I parted away with a lot of my stuff including my trusty HP, I didn’t want to lug it all the way and it was already bit out of date anyways.</p>

<p>This was what I called my <em>dark</em> era of computing since I effectively didn’t have a computer until late 2018 making do with tablets and later a smartphone. Not the best of times for me personally either, it was a <em>dark</em> era indeed.</p>

<h2 id="2018---current-asus-c101pa-3in1-chromebook">2018 - Current Asus C101PA 3in1 Chromebook</h2>

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>
<p style="text-align:center">My current computer and my first Notebook PC!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>By this time, I had gotten my first job at a Mexican restaurant and could afford to buy my own computer! After saving up all the earnings I could from tip-wage work, I was able to purchase a not very glamorous but good enough for me Chromebook!</p>

<p>It was the best for the price and very portable, something that I warmed up to as I grew up. All I needed was a device that allowed me to study, take notes, take tests, do some light coding, and light web browsing, and this small ASUS delivered that in spades!</p>

<p>It’s also a convertible, which makes it extra handy when laying on the bed or setting it up in tent mode, for example, in the kitchen!</p>

<p>It packs a Hexacore Rockchip CPU, 4GB of RAM, 16GB eMMC, and runs Chrome OS. I know those are underwhelming specs, but it works for me.</p>

<p>I have been feeling its age now that it’s doesn’t get any more updates (Auto-Update Expiry), and I tend to push its limits sometimes by running Linux apps on top of a container called Crostini, but it still has plenty of life in it.</p>

<p>I will replace it as my main device soon. Once I have an apartment, I’m planning on either building my own or getting one of these small but powerful mini PCs!</p>

<h2 id="what-about-you">What about you?</h2>

<p>Regardless, I’m interested in your computing history as well! Did you have a “dark” era like me? What operating systems have you used? Are you more of a laptop or desktop person? Let me know via my new contact page! (•‿•)</p>
