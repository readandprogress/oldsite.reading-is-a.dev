        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I frequent Discord quite often and I don’t see many members using Markdown syntax to flair out their messages, which is a shame. So after some deliberation on my part and some fellow server members showing interest,I decided to write one! This guide ‘s goal is to hopefully be easier to understand and follow than the already existing Discord Markdown 101 support page. This is, however, my first time writing a guide, so please bear with me! But with that said, let’s get to it!</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>While you can use Discord’s built-in formatting tools for some of these, using Markdown is often a better option. Markdown is a simple plain text formatting syntax that can be used to create a variety of effects, such as italics, bold, and spoilers. It’s also more portable, so you can use it on other platforms, such as GitHub, for example!</p>

<h3 id="spoiler-tags">Spoiler Tags</h3>

<p>Don’t want to spoil that awesome game ending or want to troll your friends? Just use two pipe characters on the front and back of your text!</p>

<p>Note that this is a special Markdown syntax that may only work on Discord and is not part of the standard Markdown spec.</p>

<details>
  <summary>I'm invisible!</summary>
  I'm not invisible anymore; hide me, please. : _ ;
</details>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>||I'm not invisible anymore; hide me, please. : _ ;|| 
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="italics">Italics</h3>

<p>To italicize text, all you need to do is add an asterisk to a sentence or word, both before and after. This will be the same for the following, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p><em>Look at me, I’m pointy!</em></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>*Look at me, I'm pointy!*
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="underline-italics">Underline Italics</h3>

<p>Underlined italicization uses the same asterisk character but with the addition of two undescores at the end and beginning. This is a special Discord syntax and is not possible in regular Markdown, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p><u><i>I'm still pointy but with a underline!<i></i><u></u></i></u></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>__*I'm still pointy but with a underline!*__
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="underlining">Underlining</h3>

<p>Now for just underlining, you just need to add two underscores front and back to your text. This also only works on Discord!</p>

<p><u>Sometimes you just need some underlining, ya know?</u></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>__Sometimes you just need some underlining, ya know?__
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="bolding">Bolding</h3>

<p>But what if you want to give your text more importance? That’s where bolding comes in handy!</p>

<p>Just add two asterisks! Remember, always front and back!</p>

<p><strong>I’m a ghost, boo!</strong></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>**I'm a ghost, boo!**
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="underline-bolding">Underline Bolding</h3>

<p>But what if you like some undeline with that? Just add the same characters we use for underlining; that’s two underscores if you lost track. It happens to the best of us!</p>

<p><b><u>I'm still a ghost, by the way!</u></b></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>__**I'm still a ghost, by the way!**__
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="bolding-and-italics">Bolding and Italics</h3>

<p>And if you want to be extra spicy, you can always italicize and bold at the same time with two underscores and three asterisk characters. This is different from regular Markdown, which uses just one underscore and two asterisk characters for the same effect.</p>

<p><em><strong>Just the thing you need when making a big point!</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>__***Just the thing you need when making a big point!__***
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="strikethrough">Strikethrough</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to say something but want to keep it low-key; this is where strikethrough text comes to the rescue.</p>

<p>Just add two tildes, front and back, to your text.</p>

<p><del>Sshh, don’t tell anyone. :P</del></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~~Sshh, don't tell anyone. :P~~
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-fun-stuff">The Fun Stuff!</h2>

<p>Now for the really cool stuff you probably don’t know about! Like making bulleted lists, headers, masking links, sharing your code snippets with code blocks, and more, You can do quite a lot to make yours and others Discord experiences better thanks to Markdowm!</p>

<h3 id="headers">Headers</h3>

<p>With Discord adding forum-like features, it’s really handy to use a header for detailed articles or posts you want to share on Discord!</p>

<p>Just add the hash character to make a header; be sure to leave a space before typing the header’s content. There are three header types!</p>

<ul>
  <li>( # ) For a large header, just what you need for a tittle!</li>
  <li>( ## ) For a medium header, useful for sections on an article.</li>
  <li>( ### ) For a small header.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Bigger is always better, right?
## Not so big, but not too small either.
### I'm just right! unlike the other two... 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="masked-links">Masked Links</h3>

<p>You can paste a link into the chat, but that is not the prettiest thing, right? Especially if Discord doesn’t have a preview, why not embed it in the text? Luckily, we can do that!</p>

<p>Just use brackets for the text and parenthesis for the link, and you have a masked link!</p>

<p><a href="https://reading.is-a.dev">Check out my blog!</a></p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[Check out my blog!](https://reading.is-a.dev)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>

<p>It’s pretty self-explanatory: while you could list stuff with regular, good old plain text, you can make it even prettier with Markdown!</p>

<p>Just use a hyphen before each item, and you can indent the list by adding two more extra spaces after the first bullet point.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listing is fun!
    <ul>
      <li>right?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><br /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Listing is fun!
  - right?
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h3>

<p>One of my favorites! It makes it a breeze to copy code; just add a backtick for one line of code or three if the code is multi-lined like a script.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Just imagine this is a piece of code, Okay?</code></p>

<p>See, isn’t that just better? Now all we need to do is double-click it to select it. Timesaver!</p>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>`Just imagine this is a piece of code, Okay?`
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="block-quotes">Block Quotes</h3>

<p>Finally, sometimes you need to quote a piece of text; maybe you’re doing a book club. Regardless, this is where block quotes come in handy!</p>

<p>Just add the greater-than character for a one-line block quote or three for a multiline one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t believe this guide is almost done!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took me some days to finish this, but I’m quite relieved that it’s done. It was a fun side project, and I hope you can get some use out of it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ex:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; I can't believe this guide is almost done!

&gt;&gt;&gt; It took me some days to finish this, but I'm quite relieved that it's done. It was a fun side project, and I hope you can get some use out of it! 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up!</h2>

<p>That’s it. You now have a pretty good grasp on Markdown on Discord. So what’s next? I recommend looking into other Markdown guides if you want to get into the nitty-gritty of it and use it on other platforms! For now, I would love for you to use Markdown syntax on your favorite Discord servers and make the Discord experience better for everyone! I believe everyone should give Markdown a whirl; you may be surprised at how fun it is!</p>
